# Project Title
Coding A Fitness Tracking: Exploring the Possibilities of Context-Aware Applications for Strenght training.

## Overview
This project is a reimplementation of [Dave Ebbelaar's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveebbelaar/) Full Machine Learning Project. It entails analysing sensor data and using ML model to predict a workout type and to count repetitions.
