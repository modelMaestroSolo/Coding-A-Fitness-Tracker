# Project Title
Coding A Fitness Tracking: Exploring the Possibilities of Context-Aware Applications for Strenght training.

## Overview
This project is a reimplementation of [Dave Ebbelaar's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveebbelaar/) Full Machine Learning Project. The goal is to explore, build, and evaluate models that can, just like human personal trainers, track exercises, count repetitions, and detect improper form.
